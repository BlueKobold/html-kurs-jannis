# html-kurs-jannis

This is a project in which I am going to combine learning HTML/ CSS, VIM, and git.
Maybe I will even fiddle around with VSC-Editor.

So therefor this is going to be very much a project for my own learning progress.

If however you are stumbeling over this project, feel free to contact me.

I would love to say Thank you to a lot of people which I listed below:

First of all Konrad Zuse for inventing the Computer in the first place.
After that in no particular order,
Linus Torwald, Jannis Seemann, Udemy, the people of git, GitHub, vim ...
t.b.c.
